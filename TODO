# Roadmap

* distribution queueing

* prerender activity
The html for each activity item is pre-rendered in a background job. To build a user's dashboard activities, the activity feed needs only to select the activities at the top of the list and output the pre-rendered html for each item, reducing the extra includes and joins needed in-process.

* callbacks (distribution, rendering)
